So, what are dialog commands?
Dialog commands are functions that can be executed inside
the dialog text!
They can be called by having the character '/' followed by
the function, example: /Func(3)
(if you want to have '/' in your text tough, type '//')

You can set your own commands by providing an array of
'GDialogFunction' in the execution of the 'AddCommands' method
'GDialogFunction' is intialized with the name of the command you
want to add and the function it executes.

Also, there's default dialog commands!

Default dialog commands list:

/Wait(int)
Descryption: waits for the ammount of milliseconds
specified in the argument to continue typing.

/SetSpeed(int)
Descryption: sets the character per second
of the system on the fly.

/EndDialog()
Descryption: ends this dialog prematurely and skips to
the next. (if there is any, otherwise it just ends the dialog)

/SkipCharacters(int)
Descryption: skips the ammount of character specified in the argument.
